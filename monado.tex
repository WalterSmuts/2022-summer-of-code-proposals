\section{Project Description:}

This project is one taken from the list of ideas presented by the organization
itself. Therefore the following description is taken verbatim from the
organization's website:

\begin{quote}

The core OpenXR 1.0 specification supports stereo VR headsets and monoscopic
handheld displays like smartphones or tablets which are supposed to be used as a
“magic window” into a VR world or for AR purposes; for this purpose the device’s
orientation and position is tracked to provide users the ability to move the
“window” view by moving the display device. A further use of monoscopic displays
is the “fish tank” configuration with a fixed display like a TV and instead the
head position of the user is tracked, to render the content behind the magic
window from the right perspective. (Example:
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw}). For this project, the student
will add support in Monado for tracking a face, figure out the relation of the
face/eyes to the a monitor and calculate fov values. The focus of this is not
making creating production ready code that in 100\% of the cases, but the
integration of the code into Monado. The small test application hello\_xr will
need changes to add better support for mono-scopic fish tank views, like improving
the scene setup. Depending on progress, the student can modify one or all of
Godot, Blender and Unreal to support mono-scopic fish tank mode.

\end{quote}

My understanding of this description is that the major work will lie in enabling
the face tracking feature in the Monado XR runtime. This will allow XR
applications to query the runtime for the user's head position and will enable use
cases like the magic window. The hello\_xr sample application can be used to test
this feature, although it might require some changes. If time permites I would
like to write this Magic Window application using rust and the openxr rust
bindings.

My intuition tells me the user experience may not be great. Most consumer device
cameras have a low framerate and high latency and may result in a high end to end
processing latency. I would expect the head position estimate to lag behind the
ground truth, and therefore the image on the screen will lag. This could possibly
be fixed by applying signal processing techniques such as a kalman filter or
incorporating gyroscopic and accelerometer data in the head position estimator. If
time permits, I'd like to explore these optimizations as well.

\section{Timeline:}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{minipage}[t]{.7\linewidth}
\rule{\linewidth}{1pt}
\ytl{Week 1 - 2}{Download, compile, explore Monado runtime code and example applications}
\ytl{Week 3 - 4}{Get POC working, no matter how hacky}
\ytl{Week 5 - 6}{Compile a set of reviewable/maintainable patches}
\ytl{Week 7 - 8}{Make experience improvements - i.e. kalman filter, low pass filter or performance improvements}
\ytl{Week 9 - 10}{Code review process and merge PRs}
\ytl{Week 11 - 12}{Buffer Time - Things always take longer than expected}

\end{table}

\section{Deliverables:}

There are some deliverables that are clear and very likely to be delivered. These
are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic implementation of head/face tracking feature for the Monado XR runtime.
\item Integration of this code into Monado, code-reviewed and merged.
\item A working magic window POC using the hello\_xr application. If the
application does not work out of the box, changes will be made to the application
to get to a working POC.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Then there are some deliverables that are less clear or are dependent on time
constraints:

\begin{itemize}
\item Improved head tracking using signal processing techniques
\item Rust magic window demo application
\item Support in Godot/Blender/Unreal Engine for mono-scopic displays
\end{itemize}
