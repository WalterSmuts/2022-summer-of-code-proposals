I am Walter Smuts, an Electrical and Computer engineering graduate from the
University of Cape Town. After I finished my studies I worked for Amazon Web
Services in Cape Town. I worked on a micro-services team on the EC2 control plance
a year, mostly maintaining software written in Java. Thereafter I joined a team
doing new feature development on the AWS EC2 hypervisor working primarily in C and
Rust. I really enjoyed this work and my Team although I felt like I needed to do
some more traveling while I'm young before getting stuck in the corporate world.

I left my job with the idea to make some room to travel and think about my next
venture. Working on open source software always appealed to me so this would be me
dipping my toes in the water to see what it's like.
